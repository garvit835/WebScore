## ü§î The Problem: Is This Site Legit?

We've all hesitated before clicking a link, wondering, "Is this website legit or a scam?" Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to distinguish safe websites from malicious ones. This tool was created to provide a quick, first-glance analysis to help users make a more informed decision.

## ‚ú® Core Features

WebScore generates a "Trust Score" based on a combination of the following checks:

* **üîç Google Safe Browsing:** Checks the URL against Google's massive, constantly updated blacklist of malicious websites (phishing, malware, etc.).
* **üìÖ Domain Age:** Looks up the domain's creation date. Very new domains are often a red flag for scam sites.
* **üìú Web Archive History:** Checks the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to see if the website has a long-standing digital footprint.
* **üîí HTTPS Usage:** A basic check to see if the site uses a secure connection.

## üöÄ Under the Hood: How It Works

This project is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript**, meaning it runs completely in your browser. There is no backend server. It leverages free, third-party APIs to gather data:

1.  The user enters a URL.
2.  JavaScript makes simultaneous `fetch` requests to various APIs.
3.  The responses are collected and analyzed by a simple scoring algorithm.
4.  A final report card is generated and displayed to the user.

2.  **Get API Keys:** This tool requires two free API keys to function.

    * **Google Safe Browsing API:**
        * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
        * Create a new project.
        * Enable the "Safe Browsing API".
        * Go to "Credentials" and create a new "API key".

    * **WhoisXML API:**
        * Create a free account at [WhoisXMLAPI.com](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/).
        * Your API key will be available on your account dashboard.

3.  **Add Keys to the Code:**
    * Open the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `<script>` section at the bottom.
    * Paste your keys into the `GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY` and `WHOIS_API_KEY` constants.

    ```javascript
    const GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY_HERE';
    const WHOIS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_WHOISXMLAPI_KEY_HERE';
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
